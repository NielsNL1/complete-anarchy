RUN THIS PROGRAM OR FILE AT YOUR OWN RISK! I removed 'f4' from list2 because that removes the chance it closes everything and i also removed 'w' because that could also close a tab. Your antivirus might say that malicious, the source code is in main2.py (version 2) so you can check for yourself. I also will make a 2.0 somewhere in the close future with even more choas.
